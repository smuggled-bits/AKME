They represent the smallest units of meaning and can be individual characters, whole words, or parts of words. Language models use these tokens to understand and generate text, making them essential for their functionality.\n\nIn the context of APIs like OpenAI's, tokens play a crucial role in determining the usage cost. The process of tokenisation breaks down both the input prompt and the generated reply into tokens. The total number of tokens consumed affects the cost, processing time, and API limitations. Therefore, when sending a prompt and receiving an answer, tokens are \"spent,\" which means users are billed based on the combined number of tokens used in the input and output. This token consumption mechanism encourages efficient usage and ensures the language models work effectively with diverse linguistic data.";
